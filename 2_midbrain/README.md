# Midbrain

This week, your *vehicles* will evolve into *creatures* with a range of behaviors and emotions. Which niche will your creature inhabit?

Your creature should

- avoid obstacles 
- flee from predators (loud sounds)
- interact with incoming photons 

you should interpret these fundamental requirements as you wish. 

We will discuss:

- digital logic circuits
- assembly language
- C programming
- microcontrollers
- Arduino development
