# Computers

Arduino would not normally considered a black box. But it is. It abstracts away a number of fundamental (and awesome) details about how MCUs work.

## Getting Started

Go through the grey box tutorials. Ideally in this order:
* Transistors
* Assembly Language
* Input/Output
Use these skiils to build a basic two-wheel Braitenberg Vehicle.

The move on to:
* Programming
* Computer Vision
