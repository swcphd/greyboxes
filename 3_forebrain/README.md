# Forebrain

This week, your creatures will become fully-evolved, sentient beings. They will grow an eyeball and have significantly more cognitive ability.

We will discuss:

- the command line interface
- operating systems (briefly)
- the python virtual machines
- version control
- raspberry pi development
- machine vision

You will then work to teach your new silicon-based friend how to hunt!
