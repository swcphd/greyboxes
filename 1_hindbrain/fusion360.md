# Fusion 360 tutorial
In this lesson we will learn the basics of Fusion 360 and use it to design a two-wheeled robot.

## Getting started

You need a copy of Fusion 360, which can be downloaded here: https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/students-teachers-educators  
Use your UCL email address to sign up for an Autodesk account.  
The DXF4Laser addin is very helpful. The addin can be downloaded here: [DXF4Laser.zip](DXF4Laser.zip) and installed using [this method](https://tapnair.github.io/installation.html).


## Topics covered:

* The importance of creating a new component ("rule 1" in the F360 community)
* Sketching
    * with constraints and dimensions to make a fixed sketch
    * using construction lines to aid sketching
* Extruding sketches to make bodies
* Projecting geometry into a sketch plane
* Understanding the timeline
* Creating geometry with the mirror/pattern tools
    * using construction planes for mirroring
* Using parameters to enable easy adjustment of dimensions
* Exporting flat surfaces to DXF for laser cutting
* Exporting bodies to STL for 3D printing
