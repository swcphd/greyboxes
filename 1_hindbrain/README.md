# Hindbrain Week

This is the first week of bootcamp!

This week, we'll be focusing on the very basics of circuits. This is. foundation of any intelligent robotic lifeforms that will evolve from this course.

In particular, we will discuss:

- analog circuit components and Ohm's law
- the wonders of breadboarding
- transistors as amplifiers in analog circuits
- reading datasheets for integrated circuit (IC) components
- the miracle of intelligence as understood by [Valentino Braitenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentino_Braitenberg)

To come prepared for this week, check out Braitenburg's book *Vehicles* from 1984.
