# Greyboxes

Greyboxes is a 3-week, hands-on course meant to open the technological "black boxes" that are at work all around us. By opening these black boxes—from our "smart" phones to our Oyster cards— we aim to better understand just how smart (or not) these devices are.

The overarching metaphor running through the course is [the evolution of the mammalian brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_the_brain#Early_history_of_brain_development):

nerve nets? -- 100M years --> [hindbrain](./1_hindbrain/) -- 250M years --> [midbrain](./2_midbrain/) -- 200M years --> [forebrain](./3_forebrain)


## Goals of this course

<!-- - Inspirational pep talk -- neuromorphic VLSI chips integrating neuroscience and electronics, Carver Mead + Conway revolution. Touch on light and electromagnetic spectrum, discuss smartphones and the depth of complexity. Set the stage for a hands-on view of the “full stack”.
- Key takeaways? -->

- What's in a circuit?
- What is binary logical computation and how did it develop?
- Microcontrollers-- why and how?
- What is a computer?
- How data is transmitted through circuits?
- Why is vision a hard problem?
- What is good programming practice? What is version control?

By the end of the course, we hope you're a little more confident in working to answer questions like “How would you design _____ so that it is robust/error-proof/reliable/accurate?”
