# Greyboxes

Greyboxes is a 3-week, hands-on course meant to open the technological "black boxes" that are at work all around us. By opening these black boxes—from our "smart" phones to our Oyster cards— we aim to better understand just how smart (or not) these devices are.

The overarching metaphor running through the course is [the evolution of the mammalian brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_the_brain#Early_history_of_brain_development):

nerve nets? -- 100M years --> [hindbrain](./1_hindbrain/) -- 250M years --> [midbrain](./2_midbrain/) -- 200M years --> [forebrain](./3_forebrain)


## Goals of this course

<!-- - Inspirational pep talk -- neuromorphic VLSI chips integrating neuroscience and electronics, Carver Mead + Conway revolution. Touch on light and electromagnetic spectrum, discuss smartphones and the depth of complexity. Set the stage for a hands-on view of the “full stack”.
- Key takeaways? -->
- Understanding of binary logical computation
- Microcontrollers-- why and how?
- What a computer does (the extent of the abstraction)
- How data is transmitted through circuits?
- The difficulty of vision as a machine problem
- Basic programming practices and principles (version control, types of programming)
- A good way of motivating topics is discussion like “How would you design _____ so that it is robust/error-proof/etc.” E.g. television remote, keyboard…

## What you need:

- a laptop
- a GitHub account
- Git as explained [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- VSCode + the PlatformIO plugin
- Arduino IDE
- Fusion360 (available through UCL's [software database](https://swdb.ucl.ac.uk/))
