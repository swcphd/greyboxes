# Grey Boxes (not black boxes)

This repository contains "grey boxes" (GBs) of fundamental technologies used in modern neuroscience research.
Each GB is a stand-alone set of tools, documentation, and tutorials that attempt to de-obfusicate its content.

The essential tools (hardware, software, and documentation) used to open black boxes are contained in the "white box" sub-folder.

## Getting Started

Go through the grey box tutorials, ideally starting with "computers".

## Goals

- Inspirational pep talk -- neuromorphic VLSI chips integrating neuroscience and electronics, Carver Mead + Conway revolution. Touch on light and electromagnetic spectrum, discuss smartphones and the depth of complexity. Set the stage for a hands-on view of the “full stack”.
- Key takeaways?
- Understanding of binary logical computation
- Microcontrollers-- why and how
- What a computer does (the extent of the abstraction)
- How data is transmitted through circuits?
- The difficulty of vision as a machine problem
Basic programming practices and principles (version control, types of programming)
- Course materials will be organized on Github as separate activity/day folders with Markdown documents, code. This planning document should be superfluous once the course is created
- A good way of motivating topics is discussion like “How would you design _____ so that it is robust/error-proof/etc.” E.g. television remote, keyboard…
All files live [here](https://github.com/swcphd/greyboxes/tree/master/)
- We want to stay away from slides as much as possible, as they aren’t easily version-controlled or easy to work on collaboratively
